- 👋 Hi, I’m Edwine (@edwintendong)
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a collection of simple standalone Python and FORTRAN scripts for calculating material properties and analyzing particle trajectories generated from molecular dynamics simulation packages such as LAMMPS and GROMACS etc.
      - My emphasis is on simplicity and clarity of the scripts and not on the efficiency/execution speed.
      - I want the scripts to communicate clearly the basic steps of the calculation being performed.
      - Should be easily modifiable to different use-cases.  
      - These scripts are meant to help students and researchers beginning a career in the  Soft Condensed matter physics, Computational Bio-molecular Sciences and           Chemical sciences. 
      -The motivation behind this project is that, the available analysis tools for Molecular Dynamics Simulations are usually optimized and used as "Black Boxes" ,
       with the users having no idea of what is going on within the analysis package. This can sometimes lead to wrong results.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying towards a Doctorate in Condensed Matter Physics and Material Science. Specifically I am interested in the Dynamics, Mechanical 
      and Phase Behavior of Nano-Confined Fluids and Colloidal Suspensions, Glass formers and other complex fluids.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who can contribute scripts and simulation tips (LAMMPS and GROMACS) in the Complex fluids domain
